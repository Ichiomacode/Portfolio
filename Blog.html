        Growing up as a little child i was always scared of anything called computer or anyting related to it
     I practically run or do anything to run away from it.Because i imagined that it would fall off or it
     would hurt me (funny right?).I declined every that would have made me proficient computer skills,so i can say
      i was an olodo when it comes to computer which is why i can never call this journey a dream come true.

   Graduating from school i wanted to go into food business cos i was always passionate about anything concerning food
   but i realized i needed more skills to add to my CV ,i felt it would'nt hurt or take anything from me if i give 
   it a trial and the rest we say ia a history

        Seeing myself doing tech and falling inlove with the whole process and adapting to the stress of learning
        it, is something i would always be graeful for and that is why i cannot but say thank you to my friend
        Oyediji Marvelous God bless you real big and a big shoutout to GOD for the strenth and inspiration.>
